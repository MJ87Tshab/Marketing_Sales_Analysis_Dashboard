This analysis aims to provide the Marketing Department with an insight on the product performance over the past period. Through this analysis of the data, I was tracking various metrics and trends over a time period which include product performance, seasonal revenue and highest sales per location.

### Data Sources

Shopping Data: The dataset used for this analysis is the "Shopping.csv" file which contains information of each sale made by the company.

### Tools

- Excel - Data Cleaning, Data Analysis & Creating a report.

### Data Cleaning & Preparation

  In the beginning of the data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
  1. Data load and inspecting the file.
  2. Handling missing values on the 'Color' field.
  3. Cleaning and formatting the data.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

This involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions below:

- What was the overall sales revenue?
- Which season had the highest sales revenue?
- Which category had the highest sales revenue?
- The total amount of sales per Category for each Season?
- The Top 10% of locations based on overall sales?
- Top 10 product by review ratings?
- Top 10 colors based on colour?
- The comparison between customers that used the promo code and those that did not use the promo code. 

## Data Analysis

```EXCEL```

## Findings

The analysis comprised of the following findings as per below:

1. With Fall being the season with the highest sales revenue, there should be a higher focus of marketing efforts during this season.
2. Clothing had the highest revenue sales in the item categories which should be targeted in their campaigns.
3. The Clothing category consistently had the highest sales in all four seasons, with the lowest being the Outerwear category.
4. Montana, California, Idaho, Illinois & Alabama were the notable locations based on their high sales revenue.
5. Gloves were the best rated product item and Olive was highest sold colour.
6. The total sales revenue was $233,081.00

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

- Invest more in the clothing and accessories categories to increase your sales.
- Specifically increase your marketing efforts in the Fall to maximise your revenue.
- Promote and increase gloves and olive colour items.
- Create a marketing strategy launched directly at the Top 10% locations to increase market share.
