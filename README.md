# Marketing Sales Analysis

## Project Overview

This analysis aims to provide the Marketing Department with an insight of the product performance over the past period. Through this analysis of the data, I was trying to track various metrics and trends over a time period which include product performance,  seasonal revenue and highest sales per location.

### Data Cleaning & Preparation

  In the beginning of the data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
  1. Data load and inspecting the file.
  2. Handling missing values on the 'Color' field.
  3. Cleaning and formatting the data.
